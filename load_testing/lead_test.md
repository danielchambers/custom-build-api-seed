When testing with request 1 and concurrency 1 the request was quick. Increasing the concurrency by 25 on each test didnâ€™t have any significant impact on performance. Each test took slightly more time than the last test, but not very noticeable overall. I noticed that anything passed 129 concurrency with any number of requests apache benchmark would fail, and not finish a single test. The python server also stopped. When I pushed up the requests to 10,000 or more that is when it became evident that the loads were taking a toll on the server.
